# Code
Here lies the code for each of the deep learning algorithms

The \_\_main\_\_ of the algorithms is where our specific tinkering for each algorithm exists

Data loading will also be altered

### Implemented

The following algorithms are implemented
* SdA.py (Stacked Denoising Autoencoders)
* DBN.py (Deep Belief Network with stacked RBMs)
